# TimedLED

This project was designed to allow users to install a dynamic, affordable, and energy-efficient lighting system that can be remotely
activated at pre-determined times, assisting with waking up or hands-free home lighting. The lights can be interacted with via a 
dynamic (desktop/mobile) webpage.
